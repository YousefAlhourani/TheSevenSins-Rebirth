# TheSevenSins-Rebirth
All Scripts for my Graduation Project created for Princess Sumaya's University For Technology in their Computer Graphics and Animation department.



My graduation project is called The Seven Sins : Rebirth. It is an RPG with a halloween medeival theme. It's story revolves around the main character (Gabriel) a resurrected holy knight that came back to life with a pumpkin for a head. His main job is to adventure around the world before him slaying enemies and completing quests along the way to obtain items that will ease his path. His goal is to rid the world of the Seven Sins and the Demon Lord that lords over all.

The scripts provided in this project are some of the scripts I wrote for the gameplay. This project was very enjoyable cause it improved not just my coding skills but my general skills in all aspects of game development as well, since my role in this project included:</br>

1- Creating Visual Effects for the Game</br>
2- Writing all the codes for the game systems and mechanics ( Inventory System, Game AI, Save/Load System , Third Person Controller and a Third Person Camera with collision detection, UI navigation)</br>
3-Lighting the scenes and applying Post Processing On them.</br>
4-Level Design and Enviroment Modelling using Maya 2018 to model and Substance Painter to texture.</br>

*Everything in this game was made from scratch except for the terrain textures I used royality free Images found on google*
